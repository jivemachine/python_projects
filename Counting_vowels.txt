#This is a basic function that inputs a word and return how many vowels are in said word

def count_vowels(string):

#string is the input, lets say we input 'bananas'

    count = 0
    vowels = 'aeiouAEIOU'
    for letters in string:
        if letters in vowels:
            count = count + 1
    return count
    
 # the output will be how many vowels are in the string,
 #out put for 'bananas' will be 3
